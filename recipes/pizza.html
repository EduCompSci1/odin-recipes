    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make perfect pizza at home with this classic homemade pizza recipe, including a pizza dough recipe, topping suggestions, and step-by-step instructions with photos.</p>

    <p>The following method I patched together from recipes in both Joy of Cooking and Cook's Illustrated's The Best Recipe. The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10 to 12 inch pizzas. Next time I'll be a bit more patient with stretching out the dough so I can get it even thinner.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Extra virgin olive oil</b></li>
        <li><b>Cornmeal</b> <em>(to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone) </em></li>
        <li><b>Tomato sauce</b> <em>(smooth or pureed)</em></li>
        <li><b>Firm mozzarella cheese</b><em> (grated)</em> </li>
        <li><b>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese</b> <em>(separated into small clumps)</em></li>
        <li> <b>Fontina cheese</b> <em>(grated)</em></li>
        <li><b>Cheeses:</b> Parmesan <em>(grated)</em> and Feta <em>(crumbled)</em></li>
        <li> <b>Mushrooms:</b><em> (very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed)</em></li>
        <li><b>Onions</b><em> (thinly sliced raw or caramelized)</em></li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Follow These Steps</h3>
        <p><em></em>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Pizza:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Brush the dough top with olive oil:</b></li>
            <p>Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.Repeat with the second ball of dough.</p>
            <li><b>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top:</b></li>
            <p>Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)

                Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.
                
                If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
                
                </p>
            <li><b>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</b></li>
            <p>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</p>
            <li><b>Slide pizza into the oven:</b></li>
            <p>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.

                Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</p>
            <li><b>Bake:</b></li>
            <p>Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</p>
        </ol>
