    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This seafood pasta is a mix of shrimp, clams, mussels and scallops, all tossed together with spaghetti in a homemade tomato sauce. An easy yet elegant meal that is perfect for entertaining!

    <p>When I have friends and family over, I often serve seafood such as bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp kabobs or this simple yet totally satisfying seafood pasta.</p>

     <h3>Follow These Steps</h3>
        <p><em></em>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Pizza:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. </b></li>
            <p>Add the onions and cook for 4-5 minutes or until softened. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</p>
            <li><b>Stir in the red pepper flakes (optional)  </b></li>
            <p> then add the pureed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </p>

            <li><b>Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes</b></li>
            <p>or until sauce has just started to thicken. Stir in the butter, then remove the sauce from the heat.</p>
            <li><b>While the sauce is simmering</b></li>
            <p>cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted water according to package directions.</p>

            <li><b>Drain the pasta</b></li>
            <p>reserving 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking liquid.</p>

            <li><b>Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over high heat.</b></li>
            <p>Season the scallops with salt and pepper, then add them to the pan.</p>

            <li><b>Cook the scallops</b></li>
            <p>1-2 minutes per side or until browned and opaque.</p>

            <li><b>Remove the scallops from the pan</b></li>
            <p>Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and add them to the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until pink and opaque.</p>

            <li><b>Remove the shrimp from the pan</b></li>
            <p>Place the clams and mussels in the pan, along with the reserved pasta water. Bring to a simmer.</p>

            <li><b>Cover and cook for 4-6 minutes</b></li>
            <p>until clams and mussels have opened. Discard any shells that did not open.</p>

            <li><b>Add the shrimp and scallops back to the pan</b></li>
            <p>along with the tomato sauce and spaghetti. Toss to coat everything with the sauce.</p>
        </ol>
